# This repository contains shear wave splitting datasets that we used in the article titled 'Mantle Deformation in the Highly Oblique Indo-Burma Subduction System Inferred from Shear Wave Splitting Measurements.'
# 
# "waveforms" folder contains all the windowed waveforms used in this study. Datasets are organized by the seismic networks. Inside the ".tar" file, all the SAC files are located.
# naming convention used as : YYYYJDD_STAN_HH_MM.1.sac  ==> Vertical (Z)
#                           : YYYYJDD_STAN_HH_MM.2.sac  ==> Horizontal (N-S)
                            : YYYYJDD_STAN_HH_MM.3.sac  ==> Horizontal (E-W)
# "processed" folder contains time-shifted seismograms that produced optimal splitting parameters. Fast direction (fd) and lag time (dt) information are saved in the sac header [ user1 ==> fd, user2 ==> dt, user3 ==> efd, use4 ==> edt]. 
# Inside the ".tar" file, all the processed seismograms are located.

# naming convention used as : YYYYJDD_STAN_HH_MM.f.phase  ==> fast polarized seismogram (Z)
#                           : YYYYJDD_STAN_HH_MM.s.phase  ==> slow polarized seismogram (N-S)
                            : YYYYJDD_STAN_HH_MM.c.phase  ==> corrected seismogram by time shifting

# results folder contains all the statin average, individual, and null shear wave splitting results found in this study
