# This repository contains shear wave splitting datasets that we used in the article titled 'Mantle Deformation in the Highly Oblique Indo-Burma Subduction System Inferred from Shear Wave Splitting Measurements.'
# 
# waveforms folder contains all the windowed waveforms used in this study. Datasets are organized by the seismic networks. Inside the tar file, all waveforms are located.
# naming convention used as : YYYYJDD_STAN_HH_MM.1.sac  ==> vertical
